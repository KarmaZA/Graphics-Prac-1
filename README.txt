This is the README file for Graphics Assignment 1.

The assignment has and compiles off the make file and so can be compiled with "make" and run with "make run".

This program compiles and runs on the honours labs computers and the include statements may have to be changed if compiled on a different fiels structure.

The .obj files that are loaded are included in the build folder and must be in that folder to be loaded into the program.

The program itself supports a number of transformations:
	Rotation:
		X axis: 'x'
		Y axis: 'c'
		Z axis: 'z'

	Scale:
		Increase: 's'
		Decrease: 'a'
	
	Transforms

		X negative: 'w'

		Z positive: 't'
		z negative: 'y'
